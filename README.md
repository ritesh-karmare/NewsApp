### Architecture

The architecture of this android project is implemented as MVP (Model-View-Presenter), where the Model is the Data classes, View are the Android View (Activity) files and layout files and the Presenter is where the business logic is written, in our case, fetching the news from the server.

**Working:**

From View the Presenter is initialised and we call the function in the Presenter to fetch the data from server, which in return sets the data in the Model data classes and return the Model to the View.
